This is a application made for Java servlets practice. It uses Java filters for authentication, Bootstrap for responsive design, JQuery Gmap3 and Fullcalendar plugins. It was developed on Spring tool suite. Unfortunately i forgot to save the database for applicaton so if you use this code make a local database with my database properties(table name,row name,...) which you can guess by examination of dao class.Or you could make your own database and change file db.properties which is for db connection and in PrometDao class you should make your own methods(this could be problematic because you should track method callings and change them as well).
